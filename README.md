# etchasketch
This web app simulates a version of an Etch-a-Sketch by using Javascript
 to manipulate a grid of HTML elements, altering the color of each grid 
 element as the user moves the mouse across the grid. Each pass through 
 a grid element will update the color of the element, although this is
 not apparent when using the black marker. 
 
 On the left side of the screen is a sidebar of control butttons that 
 allow the user to change the coloring function of the app, change the 
 number of grid elements, and clear the grid back to white.
