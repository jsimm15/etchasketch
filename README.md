# etchasketch
This web app simulates a version of an Etch-a-Sketch by using Javascript
 to manipulate a grid of HTML elements, altering the color of each grid 
 element as the user moves the mouse across the grid. The app will also 
 accept user input to determine the number of elements displayed in the grid.
